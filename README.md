**Download sorter**

This is simple code which transfer all file in
specified location (for my case it is download folder)
to folder named 'download sorted' which in above code
is made on desktop.

This program check the extension type of each file 
and move the file to folder maked for that type (FYI,
download sorted folder has sub folder such as image,
video, exe and others.)
